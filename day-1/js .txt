//data ka type

harsh       data should be the name
true        data should be the true
[]()        data should be the brackets
{}          data should be the curly brackets
null        data should be the  null
undefined   data should be the  undefined
symbol      data should be the  symbol
big-int     data should be the bigint 
      

there are mainly different type of data but the main data types is two

1) primitives-datatype
2) reference data-type

1) primitives-datatype
